# Geoly MCP

Geoly tracks how brands are mentioned and cited across AI engines (ChatGPT, Gemini,
Perplexity, Grok, Google AI). The MCP server exposes **up to 61 tools** (the exact set depends
on plan, mode, and write profile) across two surfaces:

- **Self / brand-own** — the customer's own monitoring, audits, GA4, and write actions.
- **Public / industry** — cross-brand competitive intelligence (Grow tier and above).

The data is correct; **most mistakes are caliber mistakes** (mixing aggregations of the same
metric name) or **flow mistakes** (calling a brand tool before resolving which brand).

## Core Principles

**1. The KPI baseline is `get_brand_overview`.**
Its `aigvr.{score,mentionRate,citationRate}` are the headline numbers and match what the
customer sees in the Geoly app. Quote these for any "what is our citation/mention/visibility
rate" question. Nothing else is the headline.

**2. Never arithmetic-average a daily series.**
`query_analytics` / `get_brand_citations_daily` return **per-day** rates; averaging them
over-weights low-volume days and will NOT match the headline. For a window number, use
`get_brand_overview`, the `recordCitationRate` metric, or re-aggregate daily rows **weighted by
`completedRecords`**. The same name `citationRate` has three legitimate calibers — see
references/metric-calibers.md.

**3. A gap in a daily line means "no monitoring ran that day", not a missing metric.**
Read `completedRecords` per row (0 or absent = no collection). AIGVR, mentionRate and
citationRate share one daily denominator, so they always have identical date coverage.

**4. Verify the caliber before you quote a number.**
mention ≠ citation; AIGVR ≠ Share of Model; record-rate ≠ URL counts; competitor tools
(`get_competitor_overview`, `get_platform_matrix`) are record-weighted, never the headline. If
two numbers disagree, it is almost always a caliber/window/platform mismatch — reconcile, don't
guess.

**5. Resolve the brand before calling brand tools.**
In multi-brand / multi-org mode, call `list_brands` (and first `list_organizations`) and pass
`brand_id`. If a brand tool errors asking which brand, run the discovery tools first.

**6. Recover from errors, don't loop.**
A `402` / "subscription inactive" or a missing `get_public_*` tool is a gating signal, not a
transient error — check mode, subscription, and plan tier before retrying. Respect truncation
markers (`_truncated`/`_shownCount` on brand tools; a plain-text `[truncated …]` marker on
public/report tools) and paginate (`currentPage == totalPages`) instead of assuming completeness.

## Connection & access (what affects your calls)

- **Auth**: the client sends `Authorization: Bearer geom_…`. The token maps to a user and the
  orgs they can access.
- **Mode → discovery flow** (decides whether brand tools need a `brand_id`):
  - **single** (one org, one brand, or brand-bound token) → brand tools auto-resolve; just call them.
  - **multi-brand** (one org, many brands) → first `list_brands`, then pass `brand_id`.
  - **multi-org** (several orgs) → first `list_organizations`, then `list_brands`, then pass IDs.
- **Subscription gate**: single-org / single-brand context returns **HTTP 402** at entry if the
  subscription is inactive. Multi-org validates **per target org at call time** and fails that
  org's tool call with an error message (not a 402).
- **Public tools** require a **Grow-tier-or-above** plan (`grow | advanced | plus | enterprise`)
  in **single-org** context. If `get_public_*` / `compare_public_brands` / `get_category_*`
  aren't available, the org lacks the tier or an active entitlement.
- **Writes** (`create_prompt`, `create_topic`, `create_competitor`, `trigger_prompt`) require the
  server to run with `?tool_profile=standard` (or `admin`); default is read-only.
  `trigger_prompt` **consumes credits**.
- **Dates**: call `get_current_date` before building date ranges; `query_analytics` ranges ≤ 366 days.

## Tool selection — question → tool

### Self / brand-own
| You want… | Use |
|---|---|
| Headline KPI (AIGVR / mention / citation rate, whole window) | `get_brand_overview` |
| Daily/weekly **trend** of those metrics | `get_brand_citations_daily` |
| A topic / text-defined **subset** daily series | `query_analytics` dataset=`topic_citations_daily` (+ `prompt_text_include/exclude`) |
| Per-prompt visibility; search/list prompts | `get_prompt_list` (per-prompt rate in `geoMetrics.aigvr.citationRate`) |
| One prompt's full detail (per-platform, SoM, competitors) | `get_prompt_detail` |
| The actual **citation URLs / sources** for a prompt | `get_prompt_citations` (`deduplicate=true` for a source list) |
| "Which queries never mention us" (blind spots) | `get_prompt_mention_rates` |
| Citation **domain distribution / ownership** | `get_citation_overview` (counts URLs, not records) |
| One domain / one page deep-dive | `get_domain_detail` / `get_page_detail` / `get_url_reference_detail` |
| Content gaps for a domain | `get_content_opportunities` |
| Standing **vs competitors** | `get_competitor_overview` / `get_platform_matrix` (record-weighted — not headline) |
| How AI *describes* the brand (verbatim) | `get_brand_mention_samples`; vs rivals → `get_competitor_cooccurrence` |
| Topic-level analysis (and to enumerate topics) | `get_topic_analytics` (pass `topic_ids`, or read its rows) — there is no `get_topic_list` over MCP |
| Sentiment | `get_sentiment_dashboard` |
| Site AI-readiness audit | `get_audit_list` → `get_audit_detail` |
| Traffic (if GA4 connected) | `get_ga4_traffic_data` / `get_ga4_page_data` |

> `display_data` / `display_chart` and `web_search` / `fetch_page` are **in-app agent only** —
> not exposed over MCP. MCP results are plain JSON (no `_ref`).

### Public / industry (Grow tier and above)
| You want… | Use |
|---|---|
| Resolve a brand/category/topic name → IDs | `search_public_entities` |
| Category leaderboard / who leads | `get_public_category` view=`brand_leaderboard` |
| Where to invest (winnable topics) | `get_category_whitespace` |
| Who's gaining/losing share | `get_category_brand_momentum` |
| What AI is being asked in our space | `get_public_search_queries` → `get_public_search_query_detail` |
| Compare 2–4 brands head-to-head | `compare_public_brands` (country+language **required**) |
| How AI perceives a brand | `get_public_brand_perception` → `…_aspect_mentions` |
| Is a topic worth targeting | `get_topic_competition_difficulty` |
| Bridge my brand → public dataset | `resolve_my_brand_public` |

Cross-ref rule: for record counts/rates use `get_brand_overview` (not `get_citation_overview`,
which counts URLs); for trends use `get_brand_citations_daily` (not by paginating citations).

## Recipes

**KPI baseline (always start here)**
```json
{ "tool": "get_brand_overview", "args": { "time_range": "30d" } }
```
Read `aigvr.citationRate` / `aigvr.mentionRate` / `aigvr.score` — the report headline.

**Honest daily trend**
```json
{ "tool": "get_brand_citations_daily",
  "args": { "start_date": "2026-05-28", "end_date": "2026-06-26" } }
```
Plot as-is; treat absent days as "no collection" (check `completedRecords`). For a window value,
weight daily rates by `completedRecords` — don't simple-average.

**Citation sources for a prompt**
```json
{ "tool": "get_prompt_citations",
  "args": { "prompt_id": "<id>", "deduplicate": true, "limit": 500 } }
```

**Text-defined subset (e.g. non-branded), 3-metric daily series**
```json
{ "tool": "query_analytics",
  "args": { "dataset": "topic_citations_daily", "dimensions": ["date"],
            "metrics": ["aigvr","mentionRate","citationRate"],
            "prompt_text_exclude": "<brandword>",
            "start_date": "2026-05-28", "end_date": "2026-06-26" } }
```

**Competitive: where can we win a category**
```json
{ "tool": "search_public_entities", "args": { "query": "<my brand or category>" } }
```
→ `get_category_whitespace` with the resolved `product_space_id` + `public_brand_id`; act on the
`prioritize` / `gap` buckets.
